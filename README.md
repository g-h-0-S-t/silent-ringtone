Welcome to the dojo of **Silent-Ringtone**, where we've turned ignoring calls into an art form. It's like having a stealth mode for your phone! 📱💨

## The Secret Technique 🤫

We've crafted a silent ringtone (that's right, a ringtone that's as quiet as a ninja's footsteps! 🐾). Assign this ringtone to those contacts you'd rather not hear from. Next time they call, it'll be so quiet, you'll hear a pin drop! It's like they're calling from another dimension...the dimension of silence. 😂

## The Ninja Guide to Installation 📲

### For iPhone Users:

1. Download the `silence.m4a` file from this dojo...err...repo.
2. Open GarageBand and import the `silence.m4a` file like a ninja imports stealth techniques.
3. Export it as a ringtone.
4. Assign this new silent ringtone to your "favorite" contacts.
5. Sit back and enjoy the tranquility of silence! 🧘‍♂️

### For Android Users:

1. Download the `silence.m4a` file from this dojo...err...repo.
2. Sneak into your phone settings and add the `silence.m4a` as a custom ringtone.
3. Assign this new silent ringtone to your "favorite" contacts.
4. Revel in the peaceful silence! 😌

## The Last Laugh 😂

With **Silent-Ringtone**, ignoring calls is now as easy as breathing! You can now ignore like a ninja, and no one will be any wiser. Remember, silence is not just golden...it's ninja! Especially when it comes to ringtones! 😂
